# WAN Video Extender PRO

![Demo](demo.gif)

## v1.3.3 - Memory-issue fix for high-low-noise-node, optional endframe für Extender-native-node

## v1.3.2 - Logic Fixes & Memory Optimization

* **Memory Fix:** Resolved high RAM usage during final video assembly in both nodes - segments now merge incrementally instead of loading all at once.
* **Reference Image Logic Fix (Native):** Fixed `use_reference_loop_X` flags not being evaluated correctly - global reference image now properly respects per-loop toggles.
* **Workflow Updates:** Updated example workflows for both native and high/low-noise nodes.

## v1.3.0 - High/Low Noise Support (Beta)

* **New Node:** Added `WanVideoExtenderLowHigh` support. You can now use separate High/Low noise diffusion models and LoRAs for more precise control.
* **New Workflow:** Included `wan-video-extender-high-low.json` to get started with the split model setup.
* **Fix:** Resolved issues with VACE module integration.
* **⚠️ Beta Warning:** The High/Low node is currently in Beta. Please monitor your **System RAM** (CPU RAM, not VRAM). Usage may increase significantly after Loop 5 depending on your hardware configuration.

---

## v1.2.1: VACE Fixes & Per-Loop Control

* **🐛 VACE Logic Fix:** Fixed a critical bug where the Reference Image would overwrite the Input/Start frames. The start context is now correctly injected and protected.
* **🔄 Per-Loop Control:** You can now set a unique **Reference Image** and toggle **Overlap** individually for every iteration loop.
* **💡 Transition Tip:** Supports using the target image of the *upcoming* loop as the Reference Image for the *current* loop to create smoother transitions.
* **📂 New Workflow:** Added an updated workflow example demonstrating these new looping features.

* **(Note: Support for "High/Low Noise Models" is coming in a future update.)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Available directly via ComfyUI Manager! Just search for 'Wan Video Extender' or copy the node file to your ComfyUI custom nodes:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Granddyser/wan-video-extender.git
```
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Input Modes

**1. Video Input (V2V)** - Extend existing video
```
Input: Video → WAN Video Extender PRO
Result: Original video + extended frames
```

**2. Image Input (I2V)** - Animate static image
```
Input: Image → WAN Video Extender PRO
Result: Animated video from still image
```

**3. No Input (T2V)** - Pure text-to-video generation
```
No input connected
Settings: default_width=832, default_height=480
Result: Video generated from prompt only
```

### Basic Settings

```
Settings:
  - extension_loops: 2-3
  - generate_frames: 81
  - overlap_frames: 16
  - steps: 4
  - cfg: 1.0
  - sampler: euler_a
  - scheduler: beta
  - positive_prompt: "your scene description"
```



## ⚠️ Resolution Handling

**Important**: The `default_width` and `default_height` parameters are **only used for T2V (Text-to-Video)** generation when no input image is provided.

When using **I2V (Image-to-Video)** or providing any image input:
- The node **automatically uses the resolution of the input image**
- `default_width` and `default_height` are **ignored**
- **Make sure your input images are already at the desired resolution** before feeding them to the node

## 🎓 Understanding Overlap

Overlap determines how many frames from your existing video are used as **context** for the next generation.

**How it works:**

```
Input: Your video frames

Loop 1:
  - Takes last N frames as context (overlap_frames)
  - Generates new frames
  - Adds only the new frames (skips overlap duplicates)
  
Loop 2:
  - Takes last N frames as context from previous output
  - Generates new frames
  - Adds new frames
  
Result: Original + all generated frames combined
```

## Understanding Image Inputs

The node has **two types of image inputs** that serve different purposes:

### 1. Global `image` Input (Top of Node)
- **Purpose**: Initial starting image for the entire workflow
- **Used once**: Loaded at the beginning and provides context for Loop 1 (if `image_loop_1` is empty)
- **Automatic context**: Last N frames are kept as overlap context for subsequent loops

### 2. Loop-Specific `image_loop_X` Inputs (Per Loop)
- **Purpose**: Optional override for each individual loop
- **Hard cut**: When provided, creates a scene cut using these frames as new context
- **Fallback behavior**: When empty, automatically uses context from previous loop

### Behavior Matrix

| Scenario | Global `image` | `image_loop_1` | Result |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Normal start | ✅ Provided | ⬜ Empty | Loop 1 uses global image |
| Hard cut Loop 1 | ⬜ Empty | ✅ Provided | Loop 1 uses loop image |
| Both provided | ✅ Provided | ✅ Provided | Loop 1 uses loop image (overrides global) |
| Auto-extend | ✅ Provided | ⬜ Empty (Loop 2) | Loop 2 extends from Loop 1's last frames |

### Typical Workflow Example
```
Global image: Initial scene
  ↓
Loop 1: image_loop_1 = empty → Uses global image
  ↓
Loop 2: image_loop_2 = empty → Auto-extends from Loop 1
  ↓
Loop 3: image_loop_3 = Next-Scene LoRA output → Hard cut to new scene
  ↓
Loop 4: image_loop_4 = empty → Auto-extends from Loop 3
```

**Key Point**: Set the global `image` input once at the start. Use `image_loop_X` only when you want to inject a new scene at a specific loop.

### Overlap Settings Guide

| Overlap | New/Loop | Speed | Consistency | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 8-12    | 69-73    | ⚡ Fast  | ⭐⭐        | Quick tests |
| 16-20   | 61-65    | 🚀 Good  | ⭐⭐⭐      | **Recommended** |
| 24-32   | 49-57    | ⏱️ OK    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | High quality |
| 40-48   | 33-41    | 🐌 Slow  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Maximum consistency |

**Rule of thumb:** More overlap = Better consistency, but slower generation.

---

## 🎨 Using Reference Images

Reference images drastically improve character consistency.

**Setup:**
```
LoadImage (Character portrait)
  ↓
WAN Video Extender PRO
  └─ reference_image input
```

**Tips:**
- Alternative: First frame from your input video
- Increase overlap up to 20 for higher consistence, but the final video will be shorter

---

## 🔄 Per-Loop Prompts

Each loop can have its own prompt for storytelling.

**Example:**
```
extension_loops: 4

positive_prompt: "woman in forest"  (fallback)

prompt_loop_1: "woman walking through sunlit forest"
prompt_loop_2: "woman discovers ancient ruins"
prompt_loop_3: "woman examining mysterious artifact"
prompt_loop_4: "woman holding glowing artifact at sunset"
```

Result: A video with narrative progression!

---

## 🎭 Per-Loop LoRAs & Prompts

**Custom Prompts:**
Each loop can use a different prompt for scene changes.

**LoRA Support:**
Load different LoRAs for specific loops (without `.safetensors` extension).

---

## 💾 How Memory Optimization Works

**Our efficient approach:**
1. **Input**: Extract only overlap frames needed → Delete rest
2. **Generation**: Each loop generates segment
3. **Storage**: Save segment to disk (`/tmp/wan_segments_XXX/`)
4. **Memory**: Only overlap + current segment in RAM
5. **Final**: Load all segments from disk and combine

**Result:** Generate long videos without running out of RAM!

**Intermediate Images:** You can also inject new images between loops by connecting different images to the `image` input for each workflow run, allowing you to guide the generation at specific points.
